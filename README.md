# Basic Portfolio

This site is designed to lay the groundwork for further study, while demonstrating an initial range of skills and competencies.

## User Story

As a web developer, having a current, professional, and well-maintained portfolio is exceedingly important.

In light of this, I devoloped this basic siteâ€” intending it to serve as the initial building block upon which I will refine and expand as I grow in my knowledge and technical expertise.

## My Portfolio

This site features an [About Me Page](https://andreloui5.github.io/portfolio_basic/), a [Portfolio Page](https://andreloui5.github.io/portfolio_basic/portfolio.html) featuring past work, and a page where others can [Contact Me](https://andreloui5.github.io/portfolio_basic/contact.html) with any questions or concerns they might have.

## Credits

In setting up this project, I closely followed the guidelines provided by the [UCF Coding Bootcamp](https://github.com/UCF-Coding-Boot-Camp/UCF-ORL-FSF-FT-11-2019-U-C).

I used [unsplash.com](https://unsplash.com/) for most of the images on the site, with the notable exception of my headshot, which was taken by Cass Russell.
