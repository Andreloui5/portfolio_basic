        <p>My name is Craig Gant, and I'm a web developer living in Orlando, FL.</p>
        <p>I received my bachelor's degree in music from the University of Nebraska at Omaha and worked full-time in the music industry for over a decade. In addition to performing, I have a great deal of experience in other aspects of the industryâ€” recording, programming, writing, and arranging.</p>
        <p>I worked for two years as the Communications Coordinator for a local church, and have over six years of experience as a professional copywriter and editor for both scholarly and commercial publications. I am excited by all elements of web development, and especially love to see creative design come to life through code.</p>
